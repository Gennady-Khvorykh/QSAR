# QSAR
##Project description
QSAR Repository is devoted to the applicaton of Machine Learning algorithms to predict the biological activity of the chemicals. QSAR stends for [Quantitative Structureâ€“Activity Relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship). 
## Data sets
* [cheminformatics.org](http://www.cheminformatics.org) has a lot of data sets from computational chemistry.

## Books
* [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. The book has a lot of examples dealt with QSAR tasks.
