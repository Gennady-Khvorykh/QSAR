QSAR means [Quantitative Structureâ€“Activity Relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship). \r\n## Data sets\r\n* [cheminformatics.org](http://www.cheminformatics.org) has a lot of data sets from computational chemistry.\r\n\r\n## Books\r\n* [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. The book has a lot of examples dealt with QSAR tasks. The back cover says:\r\n\r\n> This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a  guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
